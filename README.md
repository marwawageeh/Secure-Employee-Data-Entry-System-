# 🔐 Secure Employee Data Entry System – Python Project

A simple yet secure desktop application for collecting and storing employee data using both **voice input** and **manual typing**.  
After collecting the data, the system generates a **QR code** that contains the employee's information and saves it locally — enhancing privacy and preventing unauthorized access.
